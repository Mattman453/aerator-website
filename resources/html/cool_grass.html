					<h2>Cool-Season Grass Conditions</h2>
					<p><strong>Kentucky Bluegrass:</strong> A cool-season grass that forms dense, lush turf and is known
						for its ability to spread and repair itself through underground rhizomes. It thrives in full sun
						but requires frequent watering and well-drained soil. It’s ideal for northern climates and lawns
						that experience moderate foot traffic.</p>
					<p><strong>Fescue:</strong> A versatile cool-season grass that performs well in shaded areas and is
						tolerant of drought and poor soil conditions. It’s known for its fine blades, deep root system,
						and ability to stay green during cooler months. Fescue is great for low-maintenance lawns and
						areas with inconsistent sunlight.</p>
