				<h2>About the Smart Aerator Tool</h2>
				<p>
					The Smart Aerator Tool is a fantastic tool designed to make aerating your lawn easier, all at a low
					cost you won't even notice.
					With a design similar to other aerators but with integrated sensors and screens, the Smart Aerator
					Tool offers a similar experience while making it easier to space each hole.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is nothing quite like it currently in the industry. The Smart Aerator Tool features soil
					moisture, temperature, and
					pressure sensors to determine if aeration should be performed. Once aeration starts, the tool will
					light up a red light, staying
					red until the proper distance has been traveled. Once the distance is properly traveled, the system
					beeps and a green light
					will illuminate. Upon applying force into the ground, the system resets to a red light and continues
					until a cancel button is pushed.
