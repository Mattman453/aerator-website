			<h2>About the Smart Aerator Tool</h2>
			<p>
				The Smart Aerator Tool is a fantastic tool designed to make aerating your lawn easier, all at a low cost you
				won't even notice.
				With a design similar to other aerators but with integrated sensors and screens, the Smart Aerator Tool
				offers a similar experience
				while making it easier to space each hole.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is nothing quite like it currently in the industry. The Smart Aerator Tool features soil moisture,
				temperature, and
				pressure sensors to determine if aeration should be performed. Once aeration starts, the tool will light up
				a red light, staying
				red until the proper distance has been traveled. Once the distance is properly traveled, the system beeps
				and a green light
				will illuminate. Upon applying force into the ground, the system resets to a red light and continues until a
				cancel button is pushed.
