		<h2>1) Power On the Device</h2>
		<p>
			On the top of the unit, next to the screen, you will see a power button. Press the button and immediately
			release.
			Once the screen flashes on, the unit is powered on, and you can move on to the next step.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the unit fails to turn on after 5 seconds, check the battery and replace it if necessary. If the device
			still
			fails to power on, return the product for a replacement or refund.
		</p>
		<h2>2) Lay Device on the Ground</h2>
		<p>
			Make sure the buttons are to the right of the screen when looking from handle to footrest.
		</p>
		<h2>3) Pull Probe From Right Handle</h2>
		<p>
			Place the probe in the ground and press the OK/Power button to collect data. Wait for 5 seconds for the
			device to
			perform the necessary tests.
		</p>
		<h2>4) Check Output on Screen and Lights</h2>
		<p>
			If the green light is on, proceed to aeration. If the yellow light is on, proceed to the next step. If the
			red
			light is on, aeration is definitely not recommended.
		</p>
		<h2>5) Yellow Light Diagnostic</h2>
		<p>
			On the screen, a temperature and moisture level are present. If you know you have warm grass or cool grass,
			proceed
			to that specific page to confirm if aeration is recommended. If you don't, head to either page.
		</p>
		<p>
			On each page is a list of grasses that fall under the category of warm or cool grasses, each having a
			picture
			alongside the name. If you see a picture on a page that matches your grass, proceed to check for the
			acceptable ranges
			for that type of grass. If they match the text on the display, proceed to aeration.
