<h1>Step-by-step guide to using the Smart Aerator Tool</h1>
<h2>1)	Power on the device</h2>
<p>
  On the top of the unit, next to the screen, you will see a power button. Press the button and immediately release.
  Once the screen flashes on, the unit is powered on, and you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>
  If the unit fails to turn on after 5 seconds, check the battery and replace it if necessary. If the device still
  fails to power on, return the product to the store for a replacement or refund.
</p>
<h2>2)	Lay device on the ground</h2>
<p>
  Make sure the buttons are to the right of the screen when looking from handle to footrest.
