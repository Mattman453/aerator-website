	<h1>Smart Aerator Tool</h1>
	<p>
	  The Smart Aerator Tool is a fantastic tool designed to make aerating your lawn easier, all at a low cost you
	  won't even notice. With a design similar to other aerators but with integrated sensors and screens, the Smart
	  Aerator Tool offers a similar experience while making it easier to space each hole.
	</p>
  	<p>
	  There is nothing quite like it currently in the industry. The Smart Aerator Tool features soil moisture,
	  temperature, and pressure sensors to determine if Aeration should be performed. Once aeration starts, the tool
	  will light up a red light, staying red until the proper distance has been travelled. Once the distance is
	  properly travelled, the system beeps and a green light will illuminate. Upon applying force into the ground,
	  the system resets to a red light and continues until a cancel button is pushed.
